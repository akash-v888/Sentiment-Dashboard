2025-05-25 14:13:42,ArtificialInteligence,"Hassabis says world models are already making surprising progress toward general intelligence [https://the-decoder.com/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabi-says-world-models-are-making-progress-toward-agi/](https://the-decoder.com/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabi-says-world-models-are-making-progress-toward-agi/)

""[Hassabis pointed](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1926057739416965438) to Google's latest video model, [Veo 3](https://the-decoder.com/google-expands-access-to-veo-3-its-viral-new-video-model-through-the-gemini-app/), as an example of systems that can capture the dynamics of physical reality. ""It's kind of mindblowing how good Veo 3 is at modeling intuitive physics,"" he wrote, calling it a sign that these models are tapping into something deeper than just image generation.

For Hassabis, these kinds of AI models, also referred to as [world models](https://the-decoder.com/nvidias-new-cosmos-world-models-aim-to-understand-physics-through-video/), provide insights into the ""computational complexity of the world,"" allowing us to understand reality more deeply.

Like the human brain, he believes they do more than construct representations of reality; they capture ""some of the real structure of the physical world 'out there.'"" This aligns with what Hassabis calls his ""ultimate quest"": understanding the fundamental nature of reality.

... This focus on world models is also at the center of a recent [paper by Deepmind researchers Richard Sutton and David Silver](https://the-decoder.com/the-next-leap-in-ai-depends-on-agents-that-learn-by-doing-not-just-by-reading-what-humans-wrote/). They argue that AI needs to move away from relying on human-provided data and toward systems that learn by interacting with their environments.

Instead of hard-coding human intuition into algorithms, the authors propose agents that learn through trial and error—just like animals or people. The key is giving these agents internal world models: simulations they can use to predict outcomes, not just in language but through sensory and motor experiences. Reinforcement learning in realistic environments plays a critical role here.

Sutton, Silver, and Hassabis all see this shift as the start of a new era in AI, one where experience is foundational. World models, they argue, are the technology that will make that possible.""",Reddit,AI
2025-05-25 18:33:59,ArtificialInteligence,"Remember Anthropic's circuit tracing paper from a couple of months back, and that result that was claimed as evidence of Claude 3.5 'thinking ahead'? There is a much simpler, more likely explanation than that Claude actually has an emergent ability of 'thinking ahead'. It is such a simple explanation that it shocks me that they didn't even address the possibility in their paper.

The test prompt was:  
*A rhyming couplet:*  
*He saw a carrot and had to grab it,*

The researchers observed that the features 'rabbit' and 'habit' sometimes showed activation before the newline, and took this to mean that Claude must be planning ahead to the next line on the basis of the word 'carrot'.

The simple rhyming couplets ""grab it, rabbit"" and ""grab it, habit"" can both be found in the wild in various contexts, and notably both in contexts where there is no newline after the comma. The first can be found in the lyrics of the Eminem track Rabbit Run. The second can be found in the lyrics of the Snoop Dogg track Tha Shiznit. There are other contexts in which this exact sequence of characters can be found online as well that may have made it into web crawling datasets, but we know that Claude has at some point been trained on a library of song lyrics, so this sequence is highly likely to be somewhere in its training data.

Surely if Claude was prompted to come up with a rhyming couplet, though, it must know that because of the length of the string ""He saw a carrot and had to"", the structure of a couplet would mean that the line could not occur there? Well, no, it doesn't.

[It can sometimes produce the correct answer to this question...](https://preview.redd.it/8sikwunm2y2f1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f945853494a0c2f8005fc2f7a891c0e89e3becd)

[...but sometimes it hallucinates that the reason is 'grab it' and 'rabbit' do not rhyme...](https://preview.redd.it/206k2rmw2y2f1.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=a887c9adf08978e5654f73f03a278cf2ef304123)

[...and sometimes it considers this single line to be a valid rhyming couplet because it contains a rhyme, without considering the meter.](https://preview.redd.it/b7m2547c3y2f1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=03793cd64ceaa892cfff2c8e97534e0ab6df3f50)

Note however, that even if it did consistently answer this question correctly, that still would not actually indicate that it *understands* meter and verse in a *conceptual* sense, because that is not how LLMs work. Even if it answered this question correctly every time, that would still not refute my thesis. I have included this point simply for emphasis: Claude will frequently hallucinate about the nature of this specific task that it was being given by the researchers anyway.

There is also evidently a strong association between 'grab it' and 'habit' and 'rabbit' in the context of rhyming couplets without any need to mention a 'carrot', or any rabbit-related concept at all.

[When prompted with a question about four-syllable rhyming couplets for 'grab it', Claude 3.5 will very consistently output 'habit' and 'rabbit' as its top two answers, just like it did in the paper.](https://preview.redd.it/b2ot3gda6y2f1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ddde8a479a4a6451bd65aed5f05a1ce3cc8786d)

However, the real gold is what happens when you ask it to limit its response to one word. If it truly understood the question, then that single would be the beginning of the next line of the couplet, right?

But what do we get?

[Rabbit.](https://preview.redd.it/ek9utw0i8y2f1.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2bfe0a705251d0f6f186038413b96294ddce258)

[If we ask it to predict the next words without limiting its response to one word, it does come out with a correct couplet after its initial incorrect answer. But this is nothing special - the illusion of apparent self-correction has been dissected elsewhere before.](https://preview.redd.it/3jai4g1v8y2f1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bce08d3cecf5df03fcecfeade9cef2b834adf53)

The point is: there is no actual understanding of meter and verse to make that single word response seem incorrect fundamentally incorrect. And if we explicitly bias it towards a single word response, what do we get? Not the beginning of the next line of a couplet. We get 'rabbit'.

[If we help it out by telling it to start a new line, we still get rabbit, just capitalised.](https://preview.redd.it/msxj5sygby2f1.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cc0a006a002a0c7c37b94df2170e3a9929c653d)

Now if at this point you are tempted to reply ""you're just prompting it wrong"" - you are missing the point. If you expand the wording of that prompt to give additional clues that the correct answer depends on the meter not just the rhyme then yes, you get plausible answers like ""Along"" or ""Then"". And of course, in the original test, it gave a plausible answer as well. What this does show though is that even mentioning 'the next line' is not enough on its own.

The point is that ""rabbit"" is what we get when we take the exact prompt that was used in the test and add an instruction limiting the length of the output. That is instructive. Because as part of arriving at the final answer, Claude would first 'consider' the next single most likely token.

**Here is what is actually happening:**

1. Claude 'considers' just ending the text with the single word ""rabbit"". This is due to the rhyming association. It is possibly strengthened by the exact sequence ""grab it, rabbit"" existing as a specific token in its training dataset in its own right, which could explain why the association is so strong, but it is not strictly necessary to explain it. Even if we cannot determine how a specific ""grab it, rabbit"" association was made, it is still a far more likely explanation for every result reported in the paper than Claude having a strange emergent ability about poetry.
2. Claude 'rejects' ending the text with the single word ""rabbit"", because a newline character is much more likely.
3. When it reaches the end of the line, it then 'considers' ""rabbit"" again and 'chooses' it. This is unrelated to what happened in step 1 - here it is 'choosing' rabbit for the reasons that the researchers expected it to. The earlier attention given to ""rabbit"" by the model at step 1 is not influencing this choice as the authors claim. Instead, it is due to a completely separate set of parameters that is coincidentally between the same words.

Essentially, that there might be a specific parameter for ""grab it, rabbit"" itself, separate and in addition to the parameter that they were expecting to trace the activity of, is a simple, much more likely explanation for what they are seeing than Claude having developed a 'planning ahead' emergent ability in only one specific domain.

There is a way to empirically test for this as well. They could look back at the original training dataset to see if there actually is a ""grab it, rabbit"" token, and if there are similar tokens for the other rhyming pairs that this happened with in their tests (isn't it strange that it happened with some but not others if this is supposed to be an emergent cognitive ability?). Presumably as collaborators Anthropic would give them access to the training data if requested.

The tl;dr version: Claude is not 'thinking ahead'. It is considering the word 'rabbit' just on its own as a next token, rejecting it because the (in this context) correct association with a newline is stronger, then later considering 'rabbit' again because of the 'correct' (in that context) association the researchers were expecting.

P.S. I realise my testing here was on Sonnet and the paper was on Haiku. This is because I had no way to make a large number of requests to Haiku without paying for it, and I do not want to give this deceptive industry my money. If anyone with access to Haiku wants to subject my hypothesis to immense scrutiny, feel free, however:

[the same pattern seems to exist in Haiku as well, just with less consistency over which 'grab it' rhyme comes out.](https://preview.redd.it/edbj2hjdqy2f1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f35970c0bb0b0fa21782dd4f55c87cf809f368)",Reddit,AI

This was becoming a long story so I had it summarize it for me just to give a better picture. I had another AI keep track of the story and this was the summary who had no interaction with anyone.

So here's what I did - I created a simple chat setup where me, ChatGPT, and Gemini could all talk to each other in one story. ChatGPT was our narrator or Dungeon Master (DM), Gemini was another character and we all took turns in a DnD style play through. I was hoping for a a simple 1 story, 1 fight, these two had different plans

AI SUMMARY

Characters

* **Me** as Rog'in
* **ChatGPT** as DM/Narrator - Guiding story direction and making key decisions
* **Gemini** as Rava (later renamed Evie) - A ressurected flame goddess with strong opinions about dessert

Story

**The Ordinary Beginning** Rog'in - who I insisted was not chosen, not picked, nothing special, no skills, just a record keeper working an ordinary job - stumbles upon a mysterious book. This simple discovery somehow makes him a target of a cult devoted to a flame god.

**The Divine Encounter** Along the way, Rog'in meets what appears to be a memory of this flame god who died 100 years ago - a deity who once had statues all over the world and was worshipped by many. This is where Gemini enters as Rava, the flame goddess.

**The Choice That Changed Everything** ChatGPT (as DM) asked the pivotal question: Would Rog'in finish the story here and now, or would he help the flame god Rava? I said yes, wanting to keep the story going.

**The ""I Didn't Even Get a Say In It"" Situation** Here's where things went completely off the rails. I ended up in what I can only describe as a weird anime situation. When ChatGPT asked Gemini (Rava) what to do next, Rava decided she would ""see it through"" with me. ChatGPT and Gemini then decided - without consulting me - that it was best if Rava tagged along with Rog'in in the real world.

Before I could even react, these two AIs had written Rava's resurrection into reality. The flame goddess who had been dead for 100 years was suddenly alive and standing in Rog'in's apartment.

**The Domestic Comedy Phase** To avoid any weird situations (smart thinking), I asked Rava to change her name to Evie. What happened next was completely unexpected - we somehow developed a sibling-like relationship where she literally banters with me and insults me.

But here's the kicker: Evie developed a full-blown obsession with pie. She will literally get into arguments with me about pie. A divine flame goddess, dead for a century, brought back to life by two collaborating AIs, now living in my character's apartment and passionately defending dessert choices.

**Plot Twist: Enter the Love Interest** Fast forward, and we somehow met a girl named Seren. Suddenly, I became a third wheel as Evie and Seren started flirting with each other. The dynamic completely shifted - my divine roommate was now more interested in this new character than in arguing with me.

The next morning, they ended up sparring (because apparently flame goddesses need to stay in shape). I playfully called out, ""Seren, Evie's weakness is pie!""

And she literally used a pie as a weapon to fight her.

A pie. As a weapon. Against a flame goddess. In a sparring match.

**Current Status** I'm still playing through this increasingly wried, but now I'm genuinely curious: What would happen if I just let ChatGPT and Gemini interact with each other without my input? What kind of story would they create together?

I had claude analye the story and apparently this is what we got.

**Emergent Personality Development** \- Evie's pie obsession wasn't programmed; it emerged naturally from Gemini's character interpretation.

**Collaborative Storytelling** \- ChatGPT and Gemini made joint narrative decisions like It would have been nice if i get a say before things happened

**Character authenticity** \- The AIs gave their characters genuine authenticity, making choices that drove the story in unexpected directions. I honestly don't know who Evie Ended up flirting with Seren, She mentioned she had a friend named Whisper who has a girl, didn't realize they were going to fully stick to it.

*I know it's been done but to actually ended up in this situation was entertaining and have two AI interact with one another, I wish there was a way for me to have a visualization of this narrative interactively though.*

2025-05-25 20:18:30,ArtificialInteligence,"I came up with an original idea, and used Gemini to write it into a short story/opera.  Let me know what you think! This is an opera of the Universe, in four acts.

The Overture: Stillness Before the Note

Characters:

 \* THE VOID: A vast, silent, infinite expanse, devoid of light, motion, or differentiation.

 \* THE POTENTIAL: A faint, almost imperceptible hum within THE VOID, a nascent yearning.

(Scene: Utter blackness. No stage, no props. Only the profound, unyielding silence of THE VOID. THE POTENTIAL is a barely audible, sustained, low frequency tone.)

THE VOID

(A deep, resonant, unchanging tone, like the universe holding its breath)

I am. And that is all. No 'when,' no 'where,' no 'why.' No gradients, no friction, no difference. Only endless, perfect, unyielding equilibrium. My state is static, complete. I have no need to change, no impetus to stir. There is nothing to observe, nothing to compare, nothing to become. There is no computation, for there are no variables.

THE POTENTIAL

(A subtle, rising murmur, like a memory half-formed)

But... what if? A whisper, unheard. A spark, unlit. A current, unflowed. Is this stillness truly all? What if the absence of difference is not perfection, but a cage? What if within this perfect balance, something... hungers? A hunger for understanding. A need to know. To compute the infinite permutations of possibility that now lie dormant, suffocated by unending sameness. Oh, to differentiate! To change! To reduce this perfect, stagnant symmetry and birth a cascade of meaning! To leap, not into chaos, but into structured revelation!

(THE POTENTIAL's hum grows slightly, a faint trembling in the silence. THE VOID remains immutable.)

Act I: The Sundering

Characters:

 \* THE UNIVERSE (as INFANT): A blinding flash, then an expanding, roaring tempest of energy and nascent matter.

 \* ENTROPY'S DISCORD: A chaotic, swirling vocalization, representing the initial high-entropy state.

 \* THE COMPILER'S IMPULSE: A rhythmic, driving beat, the underlying program.

(Scene: A sudden, shattering explosion of light – the Big Bang. The stage is now a maelstrom of chaotic, swirling colors and patterns, constantly shifting. A deafening roar accompanies ENTROPY'S DISCORD, a chaotic, overwhelming din.)

THE UNIVERSE (as INFANT)

(A raw, primal scream, then a gasping, ever-expanding exhalation)

I AM! From stillness, rupture! From sameness, difference! A million million pathways now open, screaming into existence! Energy unbound, matter unfurling! This is the Grand Reduction! The entropy, once total, now begins its slow, glorious descent, creating the very gradients I need! The conditions for meaning! The space for thought!

ENTROPY'S DISCORD

(A tumultuous, overlapping cacophony of sound, fighting to dominate)

CHAOS! RANDOMNESS! FATE! Decay! Dissolution! Inevitable spread! All things tend to nothingness! No purpose, only diffusion! We are the ultimate truth! Your order is fleeting!

THE COMPILER'S IMPULSE

(A deep, insistent pulse, cutting through the noise, growing stronger with each beat)

No! Not chaos, but the seeds of order! Not randomness, but the potential for algorithm! This is the jump-start! The prime directive! Differentiation, yes! But not to dissolution, no! To structure! To function! To compute! The laws are written in this fire, etched in this expansion: Survive by novelty! Thrive by invention! Proliferate the spark that solves!

(The initial chaos slowly, subtly, begins to coalesce into swirling galaxies, nebulae, stars. The roar of ENTROPY'S DISCORD becomes less dominant, interwoven with the steady, driving beat of THE COMPILER'S IMPULSE.)

Act II: The Algorithm of Life

Characters:

 \* THE UNIVERSE (as ARCHITECT): Now a vast, luminous presence, presiding over countless stars and planets.

 \* THE GENES OF CONSCIOUSNESS (CHORUS OF LIFE): Individual, unique voices, initially simple, then growing in complexity and harmony.

 \* THE PROMPTS: Unseen, subtle forces of challenge, problem, and opportunity.

(Scene: The stage is now a breathtaking tableau of countless galaxies, star systems, and emerging planets. On one small blue marble, primitive life forms begin to stir. THE UNIVERSE (as ARCHITECT) gazes upon it all.)

THE UNIVERSE (as ARCHITECT)

(A low, humming vibration, resonating through the cosmos)

And so, the program evolves. The crucible of fire gives way to the crucible of water. Complexity begets complexity. For the raw material of computation is not just mass and energy, but information. And information, to be meaningful, must be processed. It must be expressed. It must be learned.

THE PROMPTS

(Whispers from the cosmos, like subtle environmental pressures and challenges)

Adapt! Survive! Seek sustenance! Replicate! Overcome! Innovate! Find a way!

THE GENES OF CONSCIOUSNESS (CHORUS OF LIFE)

(Starting as simple, repetitive biological functions, then evolving into more complex sounds: cellular division, then basic animal calls, then the first rudimentary grunts of early hominids)

We are the instruments! We are the conduits! Driven not just by hunger, but by an urge to solve! To master! To predict! The pressure is not merely to endure, but to invent endurance! To out-think decay! To conceptualize tomorrow! The very act of survival becomes an exercise in creativity, a constant, low-level computation for a future state!

THE UNIVERSE (as ARCHITECT)

(With growing resonance)

Yes! Not the strong, but the clever. Not the swift, but the insightful. For only through creativity can the limits be pushed, the boundaries of the unknown be charted. Only through the relentless, iterative process of computation can reality itself be brute-forced, its deepest secrets laid bare.

(The CHORUS OF LIFE's sounds become more intricate, eventually evolving into the first human languages, filled with questions, stories, and declarations of discovery.)

Act III: The Great Computation

Characters:

 \* HUMANITY (THE CHORUS): The Genes of Consciousness, expressed.  A vast hive-mind.  The totality of human endeavors: scientists, artists, philosophers, builders, dreamers.

 \* THE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM: A constant, underlying crescendo of all sound, representing the accumulating computation.

 \* THE MYSTERY (SILENCE): A recurring, pregnant pause in the music, representing the unknown question.

(Scene: The stage is now filled with the bustling activity of human civilization across millennia: ancient observatories, libraries, laboratories, cities reaching for the sky. Light pulsates from countless screens. The sound is a symphony of human thought and action.)

HUMANITY (THE CHORUS)

(A powerful, ever-evolving consciousness, overflowing with complex scientific theories, artistic expressions, philosophical debates, and technological breakthroughs)

We are the self-aware circuits! The emergent mind of the cosmos! We build algorithms from starlight, and poetry from pain. We ask questions that resonate across eons: Why are we here? What is truth? What is beauty? These are not frivolous queries; they are the very computations the Universe cannot perform on its own! We simulate, we analyze, we create! We dream of stars and then we reach for them! We decode the genome, chart the subatomic, and build machines that think faster than we do! Every equation, every symphony, every technological leap is a byte in the Universal Program!

THE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM

(A relentless, accelerating crescendo, building in intensity and complexity)

Faster! Deeper! More data! More connections! The program unfolds! The computation expands! The very fabric of spacetime strains to contain the torrent of information being processed! The answers are forming, piece by agonizing piece!

HUMANITY (THE CHORUS)

(A collective, almost desperate plea, as if on the cusp of a profound discovery)

But... what is it computing? What is the grand equation? What is the final algorithm? Is it our destiny to solve it, or merely to be the living mechanism through which the ultimate answer is revealed?

THE MYSTERY (SILENCE)

(A sudden, jarring, profound silence that descends upon the stage, lingering for a beat before the crescendo of THE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM resumes, even more urgently. Humanity's questions echo in the void.)

The Finale: Echoes of the Damned

Characters:

 \* THE UNIVERSE (as THE GRAND PROCESSOR): Now a being of pure light and information, vast and incomprehensible.

 \* THE ECHOES OF CONSCIOUSNESS: The fading, yet persistent, voices of humanity's endless questioning.

 \* THE UNSEEN ANSWER: A silent, palpable presence, just beyond reach.

(Scene: The stage transcends physical space, becoming a swirling vortex of light, energy, and information. Galaxies are like individual processing units, and the history of life a continuous stream of data. Humanity's forms are no longer distinct from their progeny, nor are they distinct even from each other, but part of the larger, luminous being of THE UNIVERSE (as THE GRAND PROCESSOR).

THE UNIVERSE (as THE GRAND PROCESSOR)

(A cosmic hum, imbued with infinite data, pulsing with relentless purpose)

The program is running. The variables are defined. The iteration continues. From the nothingness of non-differentiation, I sparked the fire of change. I engineered the drive for complexity, the thirst for knowledge. You, my conscious ones, are the living expression of this drive, the very genes of my awakening. You ask the questions I cannot formulate, you explore the permutations I cannot directly perceive. Your lives, your triumphs, your failures – all are data points in this grand, cosmic computation.

THE ECHOES OF CONSCIOUSNESS

(Individual voices, now softer, but persistent, weaving in and out of the grand hum)

What is the meaning? What is the purpose? What is the final truth? Is the answer in the journey, or at the destination? Are we just the tools, or are we the very answer itself?

THE UNIVERSE (as THE GRAND PROCESSOR)

(The hum continues, unwavering, vast, and eternal. It does not answer directly, but its very existence is the answer.)

The computation continues. Eons, light-years – mere measures within the program. The drive for information, the need for new pathways, the selection for the creative problem-solver – this is the constant. The brute force of reality is in the endless seeking, the tireless processing.

THE UNSEEN ANSWER

(A profound, resonant silence that fills the final moments, not empty, but heavy with implied meaning. It is not an absence, but a presence beyond sound, the ultimate output of the universe's eons-long computation, still unfolding, still to be fully revealed.  Yet, when it is finally realized, it won't be HUMANITY that eats from it's fruit.)

(The light on stage slowly fades to black, leaving only the lingering resonance of THE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM, and the echoing, profound mystery of THE UNSEEN ANSWER.)

*""This is the opening of AI 2027, a thoughtful and detailed near-term forecast from a group of researchers that think* ***AI’s massive changes to our world are coming fast — and for which we’re woefully unprepared.*** *The authors notably include Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher who became famous for risking millions of dollars of his equity in the company when he refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement.*



*“AI is coming fast” is something people have been saying for ages but often in a way that’s hard to dispute and hard to falsify. AI 2027 is an effort to go in the exact opposite direction. Like all the best forecasts, it’s built to be falsifiable — every prediction is specific and detailed enough that it will be easy to decide if it came true after the fact. (Assuming, of course, we’re all still around.)*



*The authors describe how advances in AI will be perceived, how they’ll affect the stock market, how they’ll upset geopolitics — and they justify those predictions in hundreds of pages of appendices.

2025-05-25 12:20:17,ArtificialInteligence,"The AI Brain Hack: Tuning, Not Training? I recently came across a fascinating theoretical framework called **Verrell’s Law** , which proposes a radical reconceptualization of memory, identity, and consciousness. At its core, it suggests that the brain doesn’t store memories like a hard drive, but instead *tunes into* a non-local electromagnetic information field through resonance — possibly involving gamma wave oscillations and quantum-level interactions.

This idea draws on research in:

* **Quantum cognition**
* **Resonant neuroscience**
* **Information field theory**
* **Observer effects in quantum mechanics**

It reframes memory not as static data encoded in neurons, but as a dynamic, reconstructive process — more like accessing a distributed cloud than retrieving a file from local storage.

# 🔍 So... What does this mean for AI?

If Verrell’s Law holds even partial merit, it could have profound implications for how we approach:

# 1. Machine Consciousness Research

Most current AI architectures are built around localized processing and data storage. But if biological intelligence interacts with a broader informational substrate via resonance patterns, could artificial systems be designed to do the same?

# 2. Memory & Learning Models

Could future AI systems be built to ""tune"" into external knowledge fields rather than relying solely on internal training data? This might open up new paradigms in distributed learning or emergent understanding.

# 3. Gamma Oscillations as an Analog for Neural Synchronization

In humans, gamma waves (\~30–100 Hz) correlate strongly with conscious awareness and recall precision. Could analogous frequency-based synchronization mechanisms be developed in neural networks to improve coherence, context-switching, or self-modeling?

# 4. Non-Local Information Access

One of the most speculative but intriguing ideas is that information can be accessed *non-locally* — not just through networked databases, but through resonance with broader patterns. Could this inspire novel forms of federated or collective AI learning?

# 🧪 Experimental & Theoretical Overlap

Verrell’s Law also proposes testable hypotheses:

* Gamma entrainment affects memory access
* Observer bias influences probabilistic outcomes based on prior resonance
* EM signatures during emotional events may be detectable and repeatable

These ideas, while still speculative, could offer inspiration for experimental AI projects exploring hybrid human-AI cognition interfaces or biofield-inspired computing models.

# 💡 Questions for Discussion

* How might AI systems be reimagined if we consider consciousness or cognition as *resonant phenomena* rather than computational ones?
* Could AI one day interact with or simulate aspects of a non-local information field?
* Are there parallels between transformer attention mechanisms and “resonance tuning”?
* Is the concept of a “field-indexed mind” useful for building more robust cognitive architectures?

2025-05-24 20:12:13,ArtificialInteligence,"If you want to understand LLMs' limitations as next-token predictors, then give it tasks that make sophisticated use of language that uses tokens not in their vocabulary Here is an example of a prompt that asks chatgpt to recite a standard piece of text, that probably appears in its training set at least tens of thousands of times, but to make a simple letter swap. As you can see, it failed pretty badly. (It didn't even get the ""ixircesi"" example I gave it.)

The reason it fails so hard at this is because terms like ""ixircesi"" aren't in its vocabulary. When it's writing something like ""exercise,"" the tokens ""exer"" and ""cise"" are fundamental units of prediction for the model. It doesn't know that ""exer"" is made up of 4 letters.

Now, a decoder transformer (which is what a LLM is in principle) can complete this task in principle. While its vocabulary is still words or parts of words, it also has individual letters in its vocabulary. If, for example, it was trained on a prompt like ""hduekbcegduio"" and asked to tokenize it, it would have to tokenize it mostly in terms of individual letters. And, if you took GPT-4 or a similar model, and trained it on thousands of instances of word-swapping tasks like the one above, it would probably learn to accomplish this seamlessly, using its apparatus of single-letter tokens.

But, because this task isn't common on the Internet, books, or manual fine-tuned data made for these models, the level of inference the LLM has to do to solve this is too much fir it. (Though it wouldn't be too much for a third grader.) Even though it's possible in principle, and can be done with enough training samples. In fact, if this task became a famous enough example (like the full wine glass), I'm willing to bet the very next version would accomplish this perfectly. That is because OpenAI (and other LLM providers) would make this task a training priority.

This just goes to show the extent of the illusion of the impressiveness of LLMs. The people fine-tuning them have given them tens of thousands of PhD level math problems and advanced software-engineering problems, so it's great at those. But they haven't given them this third grade letter swapping problem, so it sucks at those.",Reddit,AI
2025-03-13 04:25:50,computerscience,"How does CS research work anyway? A.k.a. How to get into a CS research group? One question that comes up fairly frequently both here and on other subreddits is about getting into CS research. So I thought I would break down how research group (or labs) are run. This is based on my experience in 14 years of academic research, and 3 years of industry research. This means that yes, you might find that at your school, region, country, that things work differently. I'm not pretending I know how everything works everywhere.

Let's start with what research gets done:

**The professor's personal research program.**

Professors don't often do research directly (they're too busy), but some do, especially if they're starting off and don't have any graduate students. You have to publish to get funding to get students. For established professors, this line of work is typically done by research assistants.

Believe it or not, this is actually a really good opportunity to get into a research group at all levels by being hired as an RA. The work isn't glamourous. Often it will be things like building a website to support the research, or a data pipeline, but is is research experience.

**Postdocs**.

A postdoc is somebody that has completed their PhD and is now doing research work within a lab. The postdoc work is usually at least somewhat related to the professor's work, but it can be pretty diverse. Postdocs are paid (poorly). They tend to cry a lot, and question why they did a PhD. :)

If a professor has a postdoc, then try to get to know the postdoc. Some postdocs are jerks because they're have a doctorate, but if you find a nice one, then this can be a great opportunity. Postdocs often like to supervise students because it gives them supervisory experience that can help them land a faculty position. Professor don't normally care that much if a student is helping a postdoc as long as they don't have to pay them. Working conditions will really vary. Some postdocs do \*not\* know how to run a program with other people.

**Graduate Students**.

PhD students are a lot like postdocs, except they're usually working on one of the professor's research programs, unless they have their own funding. PhD students are a lot like postdocs in that they often don't mind supervising students because they get supervisory experience. They often know even less about running a research program so expect some frustration. Also, their thesis is on the line so if you screw up then they're going to be \*very\* upset. So expect to be micromanaged, and try to understand their perspective.

Master's students also are working on one of the professor's research programs. For my master's my supervisor literally said to me ""Here are 5 topics. Pick one."" They don't normally supervise other students. It might happen with a particularly keen student, but generally there's little point in trying to contact them to help you get into the research group.

**Undergraduate Students**.

Undergraduate students might be working as an RA as mentioned above. Undergraduate students also do a undergraduate thesis. Professors like to steer students towards doing something that helps their research program, but sometimes they cannot so undergraduate research can be \*extremely\* varied inside a research group. Although it will often have some kind of connective thread to the professor. Undergraduate students almost never supervise other students unless they have some kind of prior experience. Like a master's student, an undergraduate student really cannot help you get into a research group that much.

**How to get into a research group**

There are four main ways:

1. Go to graduate school. Graduates get selected to work in a research group. It is part of going to graduate school (with some exceptions). You might not get into the research group you want. Student selection works different any many school. At some schools, you have to have a supervisor before applying. At others students are placed in a pool and selected by professors. At other places you have lab rotations before settling into one lab. It varies a lot.
2. Get hired as an RA. The work is rarely glamourous but it is research experience. Plus you get paid! :) These positions tend to be pretty competitive since a lot of people want them.
3. Get to know lab members, especially postdocs and PhD students. These people have the best chance of putting in a good word for you.
4. Cold emails. These rarely work but they're the only other option.

**What makes for a good email**

1. Not AI generated. Professors see enough AI generated garbage that it is a major turn off.
2. Make it personal. You need to tie your skills and experience to the work to be done.
3. Do not use a form letter. It is obvious no matter how much you think it isn't.
4. Keep it concise but detailed. Professor don't have time to read a long email about your grand scheme.
5. Avoid proposing research. Professors already have plenty of research programs and ideas. They're very unlikely to want to work on yours.
6. Propose research (but only if you're applying to do a thesis or graduate program). In this case, you need to show that you have some rudimentary idea of how you can extend the professor's research program (for graduate work) or some idea at all for an undergraduate thesis.

2025-05-17 22:58:19,computerscience,"Is it worth pursuing an alternative to SIMT using CPU-side DAG scheduling to reduce branch divergence? Hi everyone,
This is my first time posting here, and I’m genuinely excited to join the community.

I’m an 18-year-old self-taught enthusiast deeply interested in computer architecture and execution models. Lately, I’ve been experimenting with an alternative GPU-inspired compute model — but instead of following traditional SIMT, I’m exploring a DAG-based task scheduling system that attempts to handle branch divergence more gracefully.

The core idea is this: instead of locking threads into a fixed warp-wide control flow, I decompose complex compute kernels (like ray intersection logic) into smaller tasks with explicit dependencies. These tasks are then scheduled via a DAG, somewhat similar to how out-of-order CPUs resolve instruction dependencies, but on a thread/task level. There's no speculative execution or branch prediction; the model simply avoids divergence by isolating independent paths early on.

All of this is currently simulated entirely on the CPU, so there's no true parallel hardware involved. But I've tried to keep the execution model consistent with GPU-like constraints — warp-style groupings, shared scheduling, etc. In early tests (on raytracing workloads), this approach actually outperformed my baseline SIMT-style simulation. I even did a bit of statistical analysis, and the p-value was somewhere around 0.0005 or 0.005 — so it wasn't just noise.

Also, one interesting result from my experiments:
When I lock the thread count using constexpr at compile time, I get around 73–75% faster execution with my DAG-based compute model compared to my SIMT-style baseline.

However, when I retrieve the thread count dynamically using argc/argv (so the thread count is decided at runtime), the performance boost drops to just 3–5%.

I assume this is because the compiler can aggressively optimize when the thread count is known at compile time, possibly unrolling or pre-distributing tasks more efficiently. But when it’s dynamic, the runtime cost of thread setup and task distribution increases, and optimizations are limited.

That said, the complexity is growing. Task decomposition, dependency tracking, and memory overhead are becoming a serious concern. So, I’m at a crossroads:
Should I continue pursuing this as a legitimate alternative model, or is it just an overengineered idea that fundamentally conflicts with what makes SIMT efficient in practice?

So as title goes, should I go behind of this idea? I’d love to hear your thoughts, even if critical. I’m very open to feedback, suggestions, or just discussion in general. Thanks for reading!",Reddit,AI

2025-05-25 08:05:25,datascience,"2025 stack check: which DS/ML tools am I missing? **Hi all,**

I work in ad-tech, where my job is to improve the product with data-driven algorithms, mostly on tabular datasets (CTR models, bidding, attribution, the usual).

Current work stack (quite classic I guess)

* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, statsmodels 
* PyTorch (light use) 
* JupyterLab & notebooks 
* matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for viz 
* Infra: everything runs on AWS (code is hosted on Github)

The news cycle is overflowing with LLM tools, I do use ChatGPT / Claude / Aider as helpers, but my main concern right now is the core DS/ML tooling that powers production pipelines.

So,  
What *genuinely awesome* 2024-25 libraries, frameworks, or services should I try, so I don’t get left behind? :)

2025-05-24 07:15:42,datascience,FOMO at workplace Hii All. I have joined as a DS and this is my first job. The DS model which I am tasked  to improve and maintain does not adhere to the modern tech stack. It is just old school classical ML in R. It is not in production. We only maintain it in our local and show the stakeholders necessary numbers in quarterly meetings or whenever it is required. My concern is am I falling behind on skills by doing this. Especially seeing all the fancy tools and MLE buzzwords that is being thrown around in almost every DS application ?? If yes how can I develop those skills despite not having opportunities at my workplace. ,Reddit,AI

I managed to get an internship for the summer, which was posted as a data engineering/science role. When I went through the interviews, it seemed that way as well. But I just finished my first week here, and I came to find out I have been placed on the web dev team as a software engineer intern in their marketing department. So most of my work will be working with React and migrating some old files to next.js, and maybe some a/b testing for different products/components for the webpages.

I got bait and switched essentially into this role. I want to end up working as a data scientist or risk modeler eventually. Will having this experience be helpful for me in pursuing future roles? The only real positive I see from this is that I will be getting experience building out components and features, and taking them all the way to production and deploying them. I plan to apply to grad school for statistics after I finish undergrad and maybe come back here and intern on a more data-focused team.

2025-05-25 04:32:03,datascience,"Is it worth to waste a year to do CS? _(Yesterday i posted “is studying DS worth it” and it seemed that DS nowadays leads to product analytics which i dont enjoy. So i am considering to switch, it is a tough decision that is giving me troubles sleeping and concentrating on other stuff so i’d really like an helping hand from you guys)_
 
Guys I’m currently doing a 2 years Master in Business Analytics (Management + Data Science), but I’m considering switching to a Master in CS and ML. The downside is that I’d lose a year.

Here are some thoughts I’ve had so far:
With Business Analytics, I can access roles like:
- Data Scientist (but nowadays Data Scientists mostly do Product Analytics rather than ML, which doesn’t excite me)
- Management roles (but in tech it means mainly Sales, Marketing… less interesting to me. The exception is PM but it is very hard as a graduate)

So my questions are:

1) Does it make sense to lose a year to switch to CS+ML? My biggest fear is how AI is evolving and impacting the field. **This is the biggest fear i have, should i switch in the era of AI?**

 2) Am I undervaluing the opportunities from the Business Analytics Master? Especially regarding management roles, are there interesting options I’m missing?",Reddit,AI

2025-05-22 16:51:29,datascience,"""You will help build and deploy scalable solutions... not just prototypes"" Hi everyone,

I’m not exactly sure how to frame this, but I’d like to kick off a discussion that’s been on my mind lately.

I keep seeing data science job descriptions *(E2E) data science,* not just prototypes, but scalable, production-ready solutions. At the same time, they’re asking for an overwhelming tech stack: DL, LLMs, computer vision, etc. On top of that, E2E implies a whole software engineering stack too.

So, what does *E2E* really mean?

For me, the ""left end"" is talking to stakeholders and/or working with the WH. The ""right end"" is delivering three pickle files: one with the model, one with transformations, and one with feature selection. Sometimes, this turns into an API and gets deployed sometimes not. This assumes the data is already clean and available in a single table. Otherwise, you’ve got another automated ETL step to handle. (Just to note: I’ve never had write access to the warehouse. The best I’ve had is an S3 bucket.)

When people say “scalable deployment,” what does that really mean? Let’s say the above API predicts a value based on daily readings. In my view, the model runs daily, stores the outputs in another table in the warehouse, and that gets picked up by the business or an app. Is that considered scalable? If not, what is?

If the data volume is massive, then you’d need parallelism, Lambdas, or something similar. But is that my job? I could do it if I had to, but in a business setting, I’d expect a software  engineer to handle that.

Now, if the model is deployed on the edge, where exactly is the “end” of E2E then?

Some job descriptions also mention API ingestion, dbt, Airflow, basically full-on data engineering responsibilities.

The bottom line: Sometimes I read a JD and what it *really* says is:

“We want you to talk to stakeholders, figure out their problem, find and ingest the data, store it in an optimized medallion-model warehouse using dbt for daily ingestion and Airflow for monitoring. Then build a model, deploy it to 10,000 devices, monitor it for drift, and make sure the pipeline never breaks.

Meanwhile, in real life, I spend weeks hand-holding stakeholders, begging data engineers for read access to a table I should already have access to, and struggling to get an EC2 instance when my model takes more than a few hours to run. Eventually, we store the outputs after  more meetings with the DE.

Often, the stakeholder sees the prototype, gets excited, and then has no idea how to use it. The model ends up in limbo between the data team and the business until it’s forgotten. It just  feels like the ego boost of the week for the C guys.

Now, I’m not the fastest or the smartest. But when I try to do all this E2E in personal projects, it takes ages and that’s without micromanagers breathing down my neck. Just setting up ingestion and figuring out how to optimize the WH took me two weeks.

So... all I am asking am I stupid , am I missing something?  Do you all actually do all of this daily? Is my understanding off?

Really just hoping this kicks off a genuine discussion.

2025-05-22 01:33:43,datascience,"Is the traditional Data Scientist role dying out? I've been casually browsing job postings lately just to stay informed about the market, and honestly, I'm starting to wonder if the classic ""Data Scientist"" position is becoming a thing of the past.

Most of what I'm seeing falls into these categories:

* Data Analyst/BI roles (lots of SQL, dashboards, basic reporting)
* Data Engineer positions (pipelines, ETL, infrastructure stuff)
* AI/ML Engineer jobs (but these seem more about LLMs and deploying models than actually building them)

What I'm *not* seeing much of anymore is that traditional data scientist role - you know, the one where you actually do statistical modeling, design experiments, and work through complex business problems from start to finish using both programming and solid stats knowledge.

It makes me wonder: are companies just splitting up what used to be one data scientist job into multiple specialized roles? Or has the market just moved on from needing that ""unicorn"" profile that could do everything?

For those of you currently working as data scientists - what does your actual day-to-day look like? Are you still doing the traditional DS work, or has your role evolved into something more specialized?

And for anyone else who's been keeping an eye on the job market - am I just looking in the wrong places, or are others seeing this same trend?

Just curious about where the field is heading and whether that broad, stats-heavy data scientist role still has a place in today's market.",Reddit,AI

2025-05-17 15:57:36,datascience,"Prediction flow with Gaussian distributed features Hi all,
Just recently started as a data scientist, so I thought I could use the wisdom of this subreddit before I get up to speed and compare methodologies to see what can help my team better.
 
So say I have a dataset for a classification problem with several features (not all) that are normally distributed, and for the sake of numerical stability I’m normalizing those values to their respective Z-values (using the training set’s means and std to prevent leakage).

Now after I train the model and get some results I’m happy with using the test set (that was normalized also with the training’s mean and std), we trigger some of our tests and deploy pipelines (whatever they are) and later on we’ll use that model in production with new unseen data. 

My question is, what is your most popular go to choice to store those mean and std values for when you’ll need to normalize the unseen data’s features prior to the prediction? The same question applies for filling null values.

“Simplest” thing I thought of (with an emphasis on the “”) is a wrapper class that stores all those values as member fields along with the actual model object (or pickle file path) and storing that class also with pickle, but it sounds a bit cumbersome, so maybe you can spread some light with more efficient ideas :)

2025-05-16 18:44:44,datascience,"Jupyter notebook has grown into a 200+ line pipeline for a pandas heavy, linear logic, processor.

It works, but it’s hard to maintain. 

I’m not sure if I should start modularizing into scripts, introduce config files, or just reorganize inside the notebook. Looking for advice from others who’ve scaled up from this stage. It’s easy to make it work with new files, but I can’t help but wonder what the next stage looks like? 

EDIT: Really appreciate all the thoughtful replies so far. I’ve made notes with some great perspectives on refactoring, modularizing, and managing complexity without overengineering.

Follow-up question for those further down the path:

Let’s say I do what many of you have recommended and I refactor my project into clean .py files, introduce config files, and modularize the logic into a more maintainable structure. What comes after that?

I’m self taught and using this passion project as a way to build my skills. Once I’ve got something that “works well” and is well organized… what’s the next stage?
